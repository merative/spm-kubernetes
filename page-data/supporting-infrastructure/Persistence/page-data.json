File storage is typically leveraging protocols such as Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB).\nSome notable implementations of File Storage include IBM Cloud File Storage (CFS), Amazon Elastic File System (EFS), and Azure File Service (AFS).\n\n#### Object Storage\n\nObject Storage enables the storage of vast amounts of data in a straightforward and cost-effective manner.\nIn Azure, you can utilize Azure Blob Storage to access object storage, which is configured within a Premium Storage Account.\nWhile Azure Blob Storage shares similarities with IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) and Amazon S3 (S3), it does not offer support for the S3FS protocol interface.\n\n### Usage\n\nThe following sample configurations are examples showing how to create Persistence Volume dynamically during the deployment of SPM on Kubernetes.\n\n<Tabs>\n\n<Tab label=\"Azure File Service\">\n<Row>\n<Column>\n\nTo archive data persistently through [Azure File Service Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-files-csi), prepare the following prerequisites in the Kubernetes cluster and in your Azure subscription:\n\n* On Azure, create a storage account of type Premium\n* Within the storage account, create a Azure File Service instance, and take note of the name as \"AccountName\"\n* In the Azure File Service instance, in the Access Keys section, create a new key, and take note of the name as \"AccountKey\" (alternatively create a SAS token)\n* Navigate to the Azure File Service instance, create a File Share, select the protocol as 'SMB', and take note of the name as \"file-share-smb\"\n* Encode the values of \"AccountName\" and \"AccountKey\" (or SAS token) in Base64 and add the following section to your override-values.yaml file with the correct values inputted\n* Enter the properties as illustrated in the example below\n\n```yaml path=override-values.yaml\n---\nglobal:\n  apps:\n    common:\n      persistence:\n        ## Persistence volume to store data (such as non-log files)\n        enabled: false\n        ## If enabled, connects to a persistence storage service\n        credentials:\n          azurestorageaccountname: \"AccountName (encoded in Base64)\"\n          azurestorageaccountkey: \"AccountKey (encoded in Base64)\"\n        storageClassName: \"azureblob-fuse-premium\"\n        storageCapacity: \"10Gi\"\n        properties:\n          azureFile:\n            secretName: \"spm-persistence-secret\"\n            shareName: \"file-share-smb\"\n            readOnly: false\n        mountPoint: '/tmp/persistence'\n        jmxstats:\n          ## Parameters of the JMX Stats to be persisted on the PVC\n          # The property timerPeriod sets the value curam.jmx.output_statistics_timer_period in milliseconds\n          enabled: false\n          timerPeriod: 60000\n```\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"Azure Blob Storage\">\n<Row>\n<Column>\n\nTo archive data persistently through [Azure Blob Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-blob-csi?tabs=Blobfuse), prepare the following prerequisites in the Kubernetes cluster and in your Azure subscription:\n\n* On Azure, create a storage account of type Premium\n* Within the storage account, create a Azure Blob Storage instance, and take note of the name as \"AccountName\"\n* In the Azure Blob Storage instance, in the Access Keys section, create a new key, and take note of the name as \"AccountKey\" (alternatively create a SAS token)\n* Navigate to the Azure Blob Storage instance, create a container, and take note of the name as \"blob-container\"\n* Encode the values of \"AccountName\" and \"AccountKey\" (or SAS token) in Base64 and add the following section to your override-values.yaml file with the correct values inputted\n* Enter the properties as illustrated in the example below\n\n<InlineNotification kind='warning'>\n\n**NOTE** Azure Blob Storage is not supported on the Openshift platform\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n<Row>\n<Column>\n\n```yaml path=override-values.yaml\n---\nglobal:\n  apps:\n    common:\n      persistence:\n        ## Persistence volume to store data (such as non-log files)\n        enabled: false\n        ## If enabled, creates a PV and PVC to connect to Azure Blob Storage container\n        credentials:\n          azurestorageaccountname: \"AccountName (encoded in Base64)\"\n          azurestorageaccountkey: \"AccountKey (encoded in Base64)\"\n        storageClassName: \"azureblob-fuse-premium\"\n        storageCapacity: \"10Gi\"\n        storageAccessModes: \"ReadWriteMany\"\n        properties:\n          persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: 'Delete'\n          storageClassName: 'azureblob-fuse-premium'\n          mountOptions:\n            -
