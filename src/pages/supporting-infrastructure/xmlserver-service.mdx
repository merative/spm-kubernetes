description: XML server service

As shown in [Deployment architecture](/architecture/arch-overview/dev-workstation) the SPM XML server is a separate deployment.

A Kubernetes service is used to abstract multiple replicas to a single XML server port.
Use the following command to display the service and the port used by all the XML server pods:

```shell
kubectl get services
```

The XML server service is listed with the name `releasename-xmlserver` where `releasename` was defined during deployment.
