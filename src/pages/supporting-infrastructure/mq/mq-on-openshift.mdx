## Support for IBM MQ certified containers on OpenShift

IBM® Cúram Social Program Management (SPM) customers may obtain IBM MQ certified containers from the IBM Cloud Container Registry for use as a Supporting Program for SPM.
Use as a Supporting Program means that IBM MQ certified containers can only be used to process internal JMS messages within SPM.

SPM does not require or support the use of any IBM MQ Advanced features available in the IBM MQ certified containers.

IBM MQ certified container is supported only from SPM Version 7.0.11 and later versions.

**Note**: The IBM MQ charts found in the Runbook Github repository are sample charts based on the IBM MQ public charts published [here](https://github.com/IBM/charts/tree/master/stable/ibm-mqadvanced-server-dev).

## Operators

MQ can also be deployed via Operators. Operators are a method of packaging and deploying Kubernetes applications that take human operational knowledge of managing the application and encode it into the
package itself, which can then be shared with users. Operator deployment can be used to create a single-instance or a multi-instance deployment, as desired.

The [IBM MQ Operator](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-mq/9.2?topic=containers-support-mq-operator) can be installed using the Operator Hub. More information on  installing the IBM Operator using the OpenShift CLI
can be found [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-mq/9.1?topic=openshift-installing-mq-operator-using-cli).
When deploying in this way, a **Queue Manager** object is created.

MQ Operators used in SPM requires the values for `availabilityType`, `storageType`, and `storageClassName` to be configured prior to deployment.
These values are those located under the MQ `global.mq` section within the relevant values file.

### MQ File Systems Consideration

IBM MQ provides guidance on the functional capabilities for a file system and the testing a user should complete in their own environment.

For more information, please see the following documentation on [IBM MQ multi-instance queue manager file systems](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/testing-statement-ibm-mq-multi-instance-queue-manager-file-systems),
