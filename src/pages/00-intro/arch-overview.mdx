IBM® Cúram Social Program Management (SPM) has been enhanced in version 7.0.10.0 to enable it to be deployed on cloud native hosting platforms.
While SPM could be cloud hosted in a IaaS cloud delivery model, it would not be possible to leverage the benefits of flexibility, elasticity, efficiency and the strategic value that is offered by cloud native architecture.

This runbook shows you how to containerize an instance of SPM and deploy it on a Kubernetes environment by using Minikube.

IBM Cúram Social Program Management (SPM) can be built as a containerized
application by using WebSphere® Application Server Liberty, packaged as Docker®
containers, orchestrated by Helm, and running on IBM Cloud Kubernetes
Service.

**Note:** Database support and MQ support remains on virtual machines (VMs) as part of the initial
offering.

Containerization makes it easier for developers to develop, deploy, and operate
applications by simplifying the packaging and deployment process.
To support containerized architectures, a number of architectural changes were
made. The changes are documented below and apply only to SPM running on
Kubernetes.

* [Message Architecture](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8S5A_7.0.10/com.ibm.curam.wlp.doc/Kubernetes/c_KubJMSArchitecture.html)
  * When IBM® Cúram Social Program Management is containerized, IBM MQ Long Term
   Support (LTS) is used as the message engine to process internal application
   JMS-based deferred processing.
* [Transaction Isolation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8S5A_7.0.10/com.ibm.curam.wlp.doc/Kubernetes/c_KubThreadIsolation.html)
  * Client HTTP initiated transactions and JMS initiated transactions run on
  different WebSphere Application Server Liberty instances, integrated through
  an external message engine (for example, IBM MQ).
* [Elasticity](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8S5A_7.0.10/com.ibm.curam.wlp.doc/Kubernetes/c_KubElasticity.html)
  * Elasticity in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service is the ability to scale up or
  down pods and nodes to adjust to the load to meet the end user demand.
