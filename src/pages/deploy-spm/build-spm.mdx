**Note:** Before proceeding with the following steps, ensure that the steps defined in [Create the SPM Database](/deploy-spm/create_spm_db) are completed. This action should be only a one-off set-up.

Building IBM® Cúram Social Program Management (SPM) for deployment to Kubernetes is similar to on-premises SPM builds with some differences.
Notably, because the application server for the cloud environment is IBM® WebSphere® Liberty some target names are changed or are not supported.

Take the following steps to build SPM:

## Source the SPM environment variables

Enter the directory where SPM is installed and source the SetEnvironment script; for example:

```shell
cd /opt/IBM/Curam/Development
. SetEnvironment.sh
```

## Set up AppServer.properties and verify the configuration

Before you build SPM, add an `AppServer.properties` file to `$SERVER_DIR/project/properties`.  `AppServer.properties` must specify `as.vendor=WLP`; for example:

```properties
# Property to indicate that WebSphere Liberty is installed
as.vendor=WLP

# The username and password for the administrator role
security.username=websphere
# Encrypt the plain-text password using 'build encrypt -Dpassword=<password>'
# The encryption for the default password ("websphere") is as follows:
security.password=XOVRjjVTebM8gV953LGMLQ==

# The name of the server on which the application will be hosted
curam.server.name=CuramServer
server.name=CuramServer

# The Curam client HTTP port
curam.client.httpport=10101

# The Curam web service port
curam.webservices.httpport=10102

# Required for Building CuramBIRTViewer.ear
curam.server.port=2809
```

To confirm your configuration, run the following commands:

```shell
cd $SERVER_DIR
./build.sh configtest
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** When running `./build.sh configtest` you may experience a failed build with an `Unsupported version:` error in relation to the WebSphere Liberty version.

If this happens please refer to the [Prerequisite software](https://ibm.github.io/spm-kubernetes/prereq/prereq/) for the correct list of supported WebSphere Liberty versions.

## Set up static content

The static content server feature allows static content to be hosted on a separate web server.
This feature allows the web server that hosts the static content to be tuned for the static content and reduces the load on the main SPM application servers.
The option enables the relocation of static content to a separate server to allow for performance optimizations.

To enable static content, create a file called `curam-config.xml` in the following location `$CLIENT_DIR/components/custom/`.

Add the following to `curam-config.xml`:

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** The guidelines assume that the relative URL `/CuramStatic/` is being used.

</InlineNotification>

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<APP_CONFIG>
  <STATIC_CONTENT_SERVER>
    <URL>/CuramStatic/</URL>
  </STATIC_CONTENT_SERVER>
</APP_CONFIG>
```

**Note:** For more information, see Static Content Server in the [IBM Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.0?topic=configuration-static-content-server)

## Build the SPM server

To build the SPM server, run the following command:

```shell
./build.sh clean server
```

## Build the database

To build the SPM database, run the following command:

```shell
./build.sh database prepare.application.data
```

## Build the SPM client

To build the SPM client, run the following commands:

```shell
cd $CLIENT_DIR
./build.sh clean client
```

## Build `StaticContent.zip`

To build SPM `StaticContent.zip`, run the following commands:

```shell
cd $CLIENT_DIR
./build.sh zip-static-content
```

The `StaticContent.zip` file that is created is in the `$CLIENT_DIR/build` folder and is needed for the steps in
[Setting up the Docker® context](/build-images/setup_docker_context).

## Build the Cúram EAR files for WebSphere Liberty

Modify the `requireServer` setting in the `$SERVER_DIR/project/config/deployment_packaging.xml` file. This command works on multiple platforms:

```shell
sed -i 's/name="Curam" requireServer="true"/name="Curam" requireServer="false"/g' \
    $SERVER_DIR/project/config/deployment_packaging.xml
```

To build the application EAR files for WebSphere Liberty, run the following commands:

```shell
cd $SERVER_DIR
./build.sh libertyEAR -Dcuram.ejbserver.app.name=CuramServerCode
./build.sh libertyEAR -Dserver.only=true \
                      -Dear.name=CuramServerCode \
                      -DSERVER_MODEL_NAME=CuramServerCode \
                      -Dcuram.ejbserver.app.name=CuramServerCode
```

### Precompiling JSPs

To improve initial page load performance, use the `precompile` target to precompile the JSPs in an application EAR file before deployment. Run the following target for each EAR file.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:**  The precompile target can take up to several hours to complete. Ensure that your environment is not significantly restricted regarding available CPU, memory, and free space in the `$CURAMSDEJ` file system.

**Note:** It is not required to run the `precompile` target on the `CuramServerCode.ear`, `CuramWebServices.ear` or `Rest.ear`.

</InlineNotification>

```shell
./build.sh precompilejsp -Dear.file=$SERVER_DIR/build/ear/WLP/Curam.ear
```

## Package an SPM release.zip file

To package the build into a `release.zip` file, run the following command:

```shell
./build.sh release -Dcreate.zip=true
```

The .zip file that is created is in the `$SERVER_DIR/release` folder and is needed for the steps in
[Setting up the Docker environment](/build-images/setup_docker_context).

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** Check the zip file in later stages to ensure that its integrity or size are unchanged when copying to different directories or machines.

On OSX and Red Hat, a zip file ends with `.zip` and looks like a white file.

On Windows, a zip file ends with `.zip` and looks like a folder.
