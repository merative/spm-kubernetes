## SPM installers

The IBM® Cúram Social Program Management (SPM) release that supports deployment to Kubernetes requires running a full SPM 8.0.0.0 platform installer, which you can download from [Passport Advantage](https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/index.html).

## Installing SPM

Before you run an installer JAR file, you must have your SPM `license` folder in the location where you run the installer command.

Run each of the installers (full or delta) using the following steps:

* Substitute `<installername.jar>` with your actual installer file name to run the following command:

    ```shell
    java -jar <installername.jar>
    ```

The command starts the SPM (izPack) installer.

* If the language dialog is empty,  clicking _Next_ installs the default English language.
* If you require additional languages, restart the installer until the dialog is displayed.
