## IBM WebSphere Liberty

The following sections show you how to download and install WebSphere Liberty.

### IBM Installation Manager

After installing WebSphere Liberty you will need to apply a fix pack using Installation Manager. You can download and install Installation Manager
1.9 or later from [IBM Installation Manager and Packaging Utility](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/installation-manager-and-packaging-utility-download-documents).

### IBM WebSphere Liberty licensing

If you are an existing WebSphere customer, you are entitled to access a WebSphere Liberty license.
If you are not an existing WebSphere customer, you can download a 60-day trial of WebSphere Liberty. For more information, see [IBM WebSphere Liberty: Pricing](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/websphere-liberty/pricing).

### Install IBM WebSphere Liberty

WebSphere Liberty 20.0.0.9 is the only application server supported by SPM on Kubernetes and is therefore required.

#### Download and install WebSphere Liberty.

Browse to [Passport Advantage](https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/index.html), then search for and download one of the following packages:

* IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty Network Deployment (part number **CND1NML**)
* IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty Base (part number **CNXH7ML**)

If you are unsure of what installer to use, contact your IBM Account Executive.

Also, download and install the following packages:

* [20.0.0.9 Fix Pack](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6324189)
* [8.0.6.15 IBM SDK Java Technology Edition](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/587245#80615)

Install WebSphere Liberty as described in [Installing Liberty](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/was-liberty/base?topic=SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/twlp_inst_top.html).

When installed, create an environment variable `WLP_HOME` that points to the WebSphere Liberty installation directory. For example:

```shell
WLP_HOME=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Liberty
```

## Java

<InlineNotification kind="info">

**Java Vendor**:

The runbook suggests the use of IBM SDK Java. However IBM's SDK is not available on MacOS.

If you are following this runbook on a developer Mac, we suggest you use [Oracle SDK  Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html)
instead. All steps will be the same apart from the SDK installation procedure.
You should still set up the environment variables as described in this section.

</InlineNotification>

Java version 8 is required. See
[IBM SDK Java Technology Edition Version 8.0](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-sdk-java-technology-edition-version-80-websphere-application-server-using-installation-manager)
for download and installation information.

* When installed, create the following environment variable:
  
  ```
  JAVA_HOME=$WLP_HOME/java/8.0
  ```

* Add `$JAVA_HOME/bin` to the `PATH` environment variable.

## Database

A supported relational database is required. See [IBM Cúram Social Program Management Supported Prerequisites](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-c%C3%BAram-social-program-management-supported-prerequisites) for list of supported databases.

You need either a Passport Advantage, or an Oracle account to download the relevant database software.

* Download Db2 from [Passport Advantage](https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/index.html).
  * See the [Db2 IBM Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.1?topic=fundamentals-installing) for detailed installation information.
* Download Oracle Database from [Oracle Software Delivery Cloud](https://edelivery.oracle.com/osdc/faces/SoftwareDelivery).
  * See the [Oracle Database Help Center](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/12.2/index.html) for detailed installation information.

## Apache Ant

Ant 1.10.6 is required and can be downloaded from [Apache.org](https://archive.apache.org/dist/ant/binaries/):

* Download the Ant 1.10.6 zip file, for example:

  ```shell
  wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/ant/binaries/apache-ant-1.10.6-bin.zip
  ```

* Extract the Ant .zip file to your environment, for example:

  ```
  unzip -x apache-ant-1.10.6-bin.zip
  ```

* Create the following environment variables:
  * `ANT_HOME` - points to the installation directory
  * `ANT_OPTS=-Xmx1400m -Dcmp.maxmemory=1400m`
* Add `$ANT_HOME/bin` to the `PATH` environment variable

* Test Ant by running:

  ```
  ant -version
  ```
