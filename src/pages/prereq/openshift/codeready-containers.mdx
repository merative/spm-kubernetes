## What is CRC?

CodeReady Containers (CRC) is a minimal, preconfigured OpenShift cluster that is designed to run on your local workstation as a development environment for OpenShift.
For more information, see [CodeReady Containers](https://github.com/code-ready/crc).

Similar to Minikube in concept, CRC provides a cloud like environment locally to create and deploy an OpenShift cluster for development and testing purposes.

This page covers some common CRC operations, including deploying IBM® Cúram Social Program Management (SPM) to the CRC environment. You will use the helm charts produced in [Preparing Helm charts](/deployment/hc_deployment).

For a full getting started guide for CRC, see [Getting Started Guide CodeReady Containers](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_containers/1.23/html/getting_started_guide/index)

### Minimum System requirements

CodeReady Containers system requirements can be found here: [CRC Minimum system requirements](https://code-ready.github.io/crc/#minimum-system-requirements_gsg).

<InlineNotification>

There is a known CRC [issue](https://github.com/code-ready/crc/issues/557) with respect to resource usage. When deploying SPM on CRC our experience has shown that a minimum of 16GB will improve performance, however 32GB is optimal.

</InlineNotification>

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

Red Hat CodeReady Containers only supports platform-native virtualization technologies:

* Hyper-V on Windows
* HyperKit on macOS
* libvirt on Linux

Running CRC using nested virtualization is discouraged and not supported.

</InlineNotification>

## Installing CRC

* Create an account at [RedHat Cloud](https://www.redhat.com/).
* Create a `$CRC_HOME` folder (e.g. `~/crc_home`) to use for the purposes of the installation.
* Download the installation archive from [latest release](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/crc/installer-provisioned) to `$CRC_HOME` and extract the archive:

    ```shell
    tar -xvf crc-*-amd64.tar.xz
    ```

* On the same page, download your pull secret to `$CRC_HOME`.
* Copy the `crc` binary to `/usr/local/bin/`

    ```shell
    sudo cp $CRC_HOME/crc-*-amd64/crc /usr/local/bin/
    ```

<InlineNotification>

Alternatively, you may add the extracted directory to the `$PATH` variable instead of moving the binary.

</InlineNotification>

Whichever option you choose, you should now have `crc` in your executable path. Verify by running the following command:

```shell
crc version
```

The output should be similar to the following:

```shell
CodeReady Containers version: 1.23.1+be17b141
OpenShift version: 4.7.0 (embedded in executable)
```

## Setting up CRC

The first step is to configure the prerequisites for the OpenShift cluster, including taking control of your hosts and resolver files to provide access to the CRC cluster.
To do this run the following command, providing the workstation administrator password as required.
This procedure also creates the `~/.crc` directory if it does not already exist.

```shell
crc setup
```

Now that the basic configuration is complete, you need to edit the configuration to change the memory limit and add the path to the pull secret file downloaded previously.

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

**Note:** VPN clients can conflict with the network configuration for CodeReady Containers.
If you use a VPN client on the same environment as CRC, see the [VPN support](https://github.com/code-ready/crc/wiki/VPN-support--with-an--userland-network-stack) document in the CRC GitHub wiki.

</InlineNotification>

To change the memory limit, set the CPUs, and add the path to the pull secret file downloaded previously. Run the following commands:

```shell
crc config set memory <number-in-MiB>
crc config set cpus <whole-number>
crc config set pull-secret-file $CRC_HOME/pull-secret.txt
```

<InlineNotification>

CRC's minimum memory allocation requirement is 8GB, only a single replica SPM deployment can be achieved using this.

You should allocate as many resources as are available.

**Note:** Values for available memory are set in mebibytes (MiB). Below are some sample values.

Example memory values:

* 32768 (MiB) is equilivant to 34.4GB
* 20480 (MiB) is equilivant to 21.5GB
* 15120 (MiB) is equilivant to 15.9GB

**Note:** The greater the workload the greater the memory and processor requirements. Any changes to the CRC config require you to delete the cluster and start a new one.

**Note:** CPU limits must not exceed the physical resources.

</InlineNotification>

You can always check the configured options of `crc`, run the following command:

```shell
crc config view
```

After setup is complete, start the cluster, run the following command:

```shell
crc start
```

This outputs something similar to the following:

```log
INFO Checking if running as non-root
INFO Checking minimum RAM requirements
INFO Checking if Virtualization is enabled
...
...
Started the OpenShift cluster.

The server is accessible via web console at:
  https://console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing

Log in as administrator:
  Username: kubeadmin
  Password: kubeadmin-password

Log in as user:
  Username: developer
  Password: developer

Use the 'oc' command line interface:
  $ eval $(crc oc-env)
  $ oc login -u developer https://api.crc.testing:6443
```

Note the `kubeadmin` and `developer` credentials for later use.

<InlineNotification>

For convenience, you may set the `kubeadmin` user's password as an environment variable:

```shell
export KUBEADMN_PSW=kubeadmin-password
```

In case you need to retrieve the password later, you can run `crc console --credentials`.

</InlineNotification>

Next, set up the OpenShift Client `oc`, which is used to administer the CRC cluster:

```shell
eval $(crc oc-env)
```

If required, you can stop the cluster:

```shell
crc stop
```

Or delete the cluster:

```shell
crc delete
```

## Creating a CRC project

Create a project for the SPM deployment, again use an environment variable for your convenience when following the guide.

Create the environment variable, you can set to value to anything you like, but it should consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or `-`, and must start and end with an alphanumeric character (e.g. `my-name`,  or `123-abc`):

```shell
export PROJECT="ocp"
```

Log in as kubeadmin:

```shell
oc login -u kubeadmin -p $KUBEADMN_PSW https://api.crc.testing:6443
```

Create the project:

```shell
oc new-project $PROJECT
```

## Configuring the Image Registry

CodeReady Containers comes with an internal image registry where you can store the application's Docker images.

The registry is accessed using different URLs, depending on the use - pods use an internal registry service name, and a developer would use the public route to publish the images.

The registry URLs can be retrieved using the `oc registry info` command, with either a `--public` or `--internal` flag.

* Public URL: `default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps-crc.testing`
  * Use this when tagging and publishing images.
* Internal URL: `image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000`
  * Use this when deploying using Helm.

The public URL uses a certificate signed by the OpenShift internal CA, which Docker does not trust by default.

Docker loads all `*.crt` files under `/etc/docker/certs.d/<registryHost[:port]>` directories and uses them for verifying any self-signed certificates.

More information can be found in the Docker Documentation [Use self-signed certificates](https://docs.docker.com/registry/insecure/#use-self-signed-certificates).

Enable Docker trust certificate:

```shell
CERT_PATH="/etc/docker/certs.d/$(oc registry info --public)"
sudo mkdir -p $CERT_PATH
oc extract secret/router-ca -n openshift-ingress-operator --keys=tls.crt --confirm
sudo cp tls.crt $CERT_PATH
```

Log in to the OpenShift registry:

```shell
docker login -u kubeadmin -p $(oc whoami -t) $(oc registry info --public)
```

## Hostname configuration for CRC

This runbook uses a generic hostname of `spm-ocp.apps-crc.testing` as an example in commands and the configuration files.

You should add the CRC IP address to the `hosts` file by using the generic hostname, or else modify the usage of `spm-ocp.apps-crc.testing` in this runbook to reflect your local hostname.
