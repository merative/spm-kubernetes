## What is Apache HTTP monitoring

The Apache HTTP monitoring in SPM allows for the visualisation of metrics generated by Apache HTTP server in Prometheus (and by extension Grafana) when the server-status reporting on Apache
HTTP server is enabled. This allows for visualisations on metrics like (from the official Apache HTTP [page](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_status.html)):

* The number of worker serving requests
* The number of idle worker
* The status of each worker, the number of requests that worker has performed and the total number of bytes served by the worker (*)
* A total number of accesses and byte count served (*)
* The time the server was started/restarted and the time it has been running for
* Averages giving the number of requests per second, the number of bytes served per second and the average number of bytes per request (*)
* The current percentage CPU used by each worker and in total by Apache (*)
* The current hosts and requests being processed (*)

## How to enable Apache HTTP monitoring in SPM

To enable Apache HTTP monitoring for both the web and uawebapp apps, simply change the following setting to true in the values.yaml file employed to configure the app
in question:

httpMetricsEnabled: false

The app will need to be redeployed to pick up the new setting. Once redeployed, the app should start producing Apache metrics that are available for consumption in
Prometheus/Grafana
