## Authentication

For users to interact with OpenShift Container Platform, they must first authenticate to the cluster.
The authentication layer identifies the user associated with requests to the OpenShift Container Platform API.
The authorization layer then uses information about the requesting user to determine if the request is allowed.

Information about [Authenticating](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/authentication/understanding-authentication.html) can be found within the link.
