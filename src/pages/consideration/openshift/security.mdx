## Security

Beyond what a platform such as OpenShift Container Platform offers out of the box, your organization will likely have its own security demands.

Likewise, you may need to add your own agents, specialized hardware drivers, or encryption features to OpenShift Container Platform, before it can meet your organization’s security standards.
