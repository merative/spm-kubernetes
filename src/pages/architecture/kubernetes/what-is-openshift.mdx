OpenShift is an open source hybrid cloud application Platform as a Service (PaaS) developed by Red Hat. Red Hat also offers a version of OpenShift for private clouds called OpenShift Enterprise.

OpenShift uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and its SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) subsystem as its foundation. OpenShift supports multiple languages for ease of development, including Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, Perl and Node.js.
