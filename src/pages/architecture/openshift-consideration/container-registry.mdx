## Container Registry

OpenShift Container Platform provides a built-in [container image registry](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/registry/architecture-component-imageregistry.html) that runs as a standard workload on the cluster.

The registry is configured and managed by an infrastructure Operator.
It provides an out-of-the-box solution for users to manage the images that run their workloads, and runs on top of the existing cluster infrastructure.
This registry can be scaled up or down like any other cluster workload and does not require specific infrastructure provisioning.

In addition, it is integrated into the cluster user authentication and authorization system, which means that access to create and retrieve images is controlled by defining user permissions on the image resources.
