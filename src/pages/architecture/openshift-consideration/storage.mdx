## Storage

Managing storage is a distinct problem from managing compute resources. OpenShift Container Platform uses the Kubernetes `PersistentVolume` (PV) framework to allow cluster administrators to provision persistent storage for a cluster.
Developers can use `PersistentVolumeClaims` (PVCs) to request PV resources without having specific knowledge of the underlying storage infrastructure.

More information can be found in the [Persistent storage overview](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/storage/understanding-persistent-storage.html) page on OpenShift.
