## Introduction

* The Apps chart is a component of IBM Cúram Social Program Management (SPM) Platform responsible for providing the Liberty runtime of the application.

## Chart Details

* Deployment of a single pod listening on port 8443
* Exposed to the cluster using a service for potential load balancing

## Prerequisites

* [`PodDisruptionBudgets`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/) are recommended for high resiliency in an application during risky operations, such as draining a node for maintenance or scaling down a cluster.
* Access to a populated enterprise database.
