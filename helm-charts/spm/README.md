# spm

## Introduction

* The SPM chart is the umbrella Helm chart for IBM Cúram Social Program Management (SPM) Platform responsible for coordinating the deployment of the application across multiple subcharts.

## Chart Details

* Deployment of a single XML server replica
* Deployment of a single IHS replica with static content
* Deployment of a single MQ replica
* Deployment of a single Cúram application replica (one producer pod, one consumer pod)
* Starting from `spm-kubernetes` release `21.7.0`, chart versions have been updated to align with the release version.

## Prerequisites

* [`PodDisruptionBudgets`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/) are recommended for high resiliency in an application during risky operations, such as draining a node for maintenance or scaling down a cluster.
